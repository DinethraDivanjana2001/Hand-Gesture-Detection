## Project Description
This project aims to harness the power of machine vision and deep learning to create a robust image recognition system. The system is designed to identify and classify objects within images with high accuracy, utilizing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Features
- **Image Classification:** Identifies and classifies objects within images.
- **Real-time Processing:** Capable of processing images in real-time for immediate feedback.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes advanced CNN architectures for superior accuracy.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of image categories.

## Components
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **CNN Architecture:** Custom or pre-trained  models like VGG16, ResNet50, etc.
- **Hardware:** GPU for training, CPU for deployment
- **Dataset:** Custom or publicly available datasets like ImageNet, CIFAR-10, etc.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of labeled images for training and testing.
2. **Preprocessing:** Normalize and augment the images to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training:** Train the CNN using the training dataset.
4. **Evaluation:** Test the model on the validation dataset to fine-tune hyperparameters.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-time image classification.

## Usage
1. **Setup:** Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-vision-deep-learning.git
